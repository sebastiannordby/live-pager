# LivePager

LivePager is a scalable real-time tracking application built with Orleans .NET. It is designed to assist in search-and-rescue missions, helping teams track their progress in locating missing people, pets, or other items.

The app enables users to create "missions" where a search area is defined by a radius from a central point. Members of the team can join the mission and update their location in real-time, allowing everyone involved to see where they are and coordinate their efforts effectively.

Key features include:

Mission Creation: Define search areas and invite team members to join.
Real-Time Location Tracking: Track the location of all users participating in the mission on a map.
Search Coordination: Collaborate with others by visually seeing areas that have been covered and which team members are currently searching.
Mission Overview: A centralized view of the mission's progress, showing all active participants, search areas, and coverage.
LivePager is ideal for use in search-and-rescue operations, organized search missions for missing persons, pets, or other situations that require team-based location tracking.
